## Medical Credential Management System

### Overview:
The Medical Credential Management System is a Java-based application designed to facilitate the management of medical credentials for healthcare professionals. This system allows users to apply for medical credential approval, check the status of their credential requests, update their account details, and perform other related tasks.

### Features:
- **User Authentication:** Users can securely log in to the system using their credentials.
- **Medical Credential Application:** Healthcare professionals can apply for medical credential approval by filling out a form with their relevant information.
- **Credential Status Checking:** Users can check the status of their credential approval requests to track progress.
- **Account Management:** Users have the option to update their account details, such as name, email, password, and contact information.
- **Role-based Access Control:** Different roles (e.g., admin, staff, medical board) have different access levels and permissions within the system.

### Technologies Used:
- Java Programming Language 🚀: Java provides the core foundation for developing the application logic and functionality.
- Gson Library for JSON Handling 📋: Gson is used to handle JSON data serialization and deserialization, enabling efficient communication and data storage.
- Blockchain Technology 🔐: Blockchain is utilized for secure data storage and tamper-resistant record-keeping, ensuring the integrity and immutability of medical credential data.
- Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) 🛡️: JCA is employed for cryptographic operations such as encryption and decryption, utilizing algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 512-bit SHA encryption for enhanced security.
- Digital Signature 📝: Digital signatures are implemented to provide authentication and integrity verification for medical credential documents, ensuring their validity and authenticity.
- Apache Maven for Project Management and Build Automation 🛠️: Maven is used to manage project dependencies, configure build processes, and streamline the development workflow.
